# arduinoPythonInterface

## Purpose

This mini-project was demonstrated to the MUN Aerospace Design Club. The purpose of these scripts were to test interfacing the Arduino
with Python via serial communications. Additionally, this test was meant to see the feasibility of using OpenGL graphics to simulate 
an 'artificial horizon' for the ground station.

## Moving Forward

The next step in this project is to extend the canvas and include readings from the other sensors. Additionally, the program needs to be 
tested to see if the data from the accelerometer is still usable when transmitted via the airborne RF transmitters.
